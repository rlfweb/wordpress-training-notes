tachyons is a lightweight toolkit which doesn't make assumptions about your design (unlike bootstrap). you can bring into your project and build up almost any design. 

Coolmat being a very simple site, could just do in css.  

But a larger site with lots of pages and componentns, great to use tachyons.
