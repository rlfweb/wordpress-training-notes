Copy this from homepage:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons@4.12.0/css/tachyons.min.css"/>

Paste into header.php just above 

<?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>

So tachyons is on our page as it loads and we can make use of it on the page 

Delete everything in style.css except for Accessibility (including from contents list)
Delete Normalize too as that is included in tachyons 

And add our own custom.css into functions.php around line 148 

	wp_enqueue_style( 'nomadsun-custom', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/custom.css');

  CMD + SHIFT + R 
  to reload with CSS 

  Go onto website and see all the different classes you can add directly to elements

  An example of tachyons
With tachyons we add class names to our elements that do one thing for us but do it well. We can combine multiple classes to build up our components.

These are called utility classes, in this case we’re making a padded box with our largest font size set in a bold weight.

================

<div class="pa3">
  <h1 class="f2 b ma0">Bold marginless padded text</h1>
</div>

Here we use the classes…

pa3: padding on all sides of 3 units
f2: the second font size in the type scale
b: make the text bold
ma0: zero margins on all sides

Styling our hero using tachyons

Using a combination of tachyons classes we can build up our components from smaller pieces, which we can then re-use in other places too.

<section class="hero min-vh-100 cover bg-center flex items-center justify-center">
    <div class="hero-content white tc">
      <h1 class="hero-heading archivo b mt0 mb3 ttu">Hong Kong</h1>
      <p class="hero-subhead tenor mb6 mt0 ttu">Incense Harbor</p>
      <p class="f6 date archivo ma0 ttu tracked">Underneath the glass and steel of Hong Kong’s…</p>
    </div>
  </section>
