Components are like LEGO bricks. We can use and reuse them in multiple places to build up any number of variations of content for our page.

With components we can massively cut down on repeated code, keeping things very lightweight and flexible.

So might have a hero component with a background image, title, subtitle and date. And can reuse that across teh site.
