What are arrays?

Arrays are lists of things which are ordered and we can loop through. A bit like a shopping or todo list.

Weâ€™ll often use the word list to talk about them because it makes more sense than the technical term array.

// a list of the wonderful superhi team
$superhi = array(
  'lawrence', 
  'kristen', 
  'milan', 
  'rik', 
  'adam', 
  'ryan'
)


Looping over arrays

With our array (list) we can use foreach to loop over each individual item in there.
// looping an array using foreach
$superhi = array('lawrence', 'kristen', 'milan', 'rik', 'adam', 'ryan');

// will loop through each item and echo it out
foreach ($superhi as $person) {
  echo $person;
}
We can even take things a step further and run functions on each item in our list, such as our shout_name function from earlier.
