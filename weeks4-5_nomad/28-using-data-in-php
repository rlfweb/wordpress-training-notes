Objects in php

LIke JSON Objects but different syntax. 

Using data in PHP
With almost all coding languages we can store data about something (e.g. a post or image) in an object. An object is a container of related data.

We’ll be using the same idea later on when we build our gallery, getting the caption and size info for our images which are stored in objects.

// here we have an object called $lawrence
$lawrence = array(
  first_name  => 'Lawrence',
  last_name => 'Gosset',
  location => 'London',
  age => 27
);

echo $lawrence['location']
// gives us 'London'

=============

Inspecting our data 🔍
If we want to inspect some code visibly on our page we can use print_r which will show us all the contents.

// to see our variable’s contents in the browser we can do
print_r($lawrence)

Very useful for when we don’t know what’s going on with our data or what it looks like! print_r let’s us take a peek inside.
