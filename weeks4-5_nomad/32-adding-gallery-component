Can go into our Post i.e. for Hong Kong and click Add component and choose Gallery. 

Then you click on the Add to gallery button and choose the image you want to show. Just one if it's a full width one. 

Then maybe you have some text so you click Add Component and then choose Text Block. 

And then you maybe want three images in a gallery so you click Add component and choose Gallery and import the three images you want 

And so on. 

And then if you collapse the view of the components, you can move them around in order on the page. Super flexible and fab. 

And click Update to add that to your page. 

But the pictures won't appear yet as we've not got it in our code. 

So go to content.php 

Add this at the end of the loop where we bring in the header and the text block: 

<?php elseif ( get_row_layout() == 'gallery' ): ?>
<?php $images = get_sub_field('gallery'); ?>


THIS IS WRONG IN SOME WAY AND DOESN'T WORK: 
Underneath, can write:  
<?php foreach($images as image) {
  print_r($images);
   } ?>
And that will print the contents of the array onto the localhost webpage we have within the variable $images
