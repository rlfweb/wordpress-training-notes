php 

We don't need to use much php for using wordpress and build great sites for clients 

Functions let us do tasks, like calculating the total price for a shopping cart, or pulling together lots of data.

We can use functions to package up tasks that may be repetitive, advanced and help us along.

You can just put in any random functions into your functions.php and then use them in the rest of the site 

Functions have a name, optional inputs (arguments) and optional outputs (return values.

// function called shout_name with a $name argument
function shout_name($name) {
  // $name is a variable that represents the input
  // the function will return the $name in uppercase
  echo strtoupper($name);
}

// we use it like this
shout_name('Dan!'); // gives us back `DAN!`
Lovely stuff! But how is this useful for our WordPress code?
