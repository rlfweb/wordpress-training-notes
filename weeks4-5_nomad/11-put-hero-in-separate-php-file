We are currently getting all of our hero posts on the homepage becuase we have loop on content.php and that is where we have put our hero code. 

So cut and paste that whole hero section into a new file. 

content-hero.php

And then in index.php, use this: 

				// here we include our hero component file 
				get_template_part( 'template-parts/content-hero' );

within the while loop 

/* Start the Loop */
			while ( have_posts() ) :
				the_post();


and so we have a reusable component that we can use in different places on the site.
