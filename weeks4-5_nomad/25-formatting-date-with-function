We currently use our date in both content.php and content-hero.php 

So instead we can write a function and then call it in different places. 

So put this in functions.php 

function nice_date($date) {
	echo date("F Y", strtotime($date)); 
}

And where you use it, put this: 

<?php 
  nice_date(get_field('date')); 
?>
