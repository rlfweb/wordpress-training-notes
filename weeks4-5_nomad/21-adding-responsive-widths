min-vh-100 means the image's vertical height takes up 100% of the viewport. We may want that to be 50% on mobiles with responsive design. 

i.e. within content.php

			<!-- header	-->
			<!-- header only has flexbox on large screens -->
	<div class="flex-l"> 

			<!-- header background image on the left -->
			<!-- header background has 100% width on anything below a large screen and 60% on large screens. 50vh on smaller screens and 100vh on large screens -->
		<div class="w-100 w-60-l vh-50 vh-100-l cover bg-center" style="
				<?php if( get_field('hero_image') ): ?>
    		background-image: url(<?php the_field('hero_image'); ?>);
				<?php endif; ?>"></div>

			<!-- header content on the right-->
			<!-- by default our header content block is 100% width and then width 40% on large screens -->
		<div class="w-100 w-40-l flex items-center justify-center ph4">
