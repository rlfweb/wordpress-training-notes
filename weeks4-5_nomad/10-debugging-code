Debugging our code with tail command

Oftentimes our code will break, it happens to all of us all the time. But how can we figure out whatâ€™s going wrong?

We can use a terminal to check through our error log file and it will tell us where things are going wrong.

THIS IS MAMP'S ERROR LOG 

tail -F /Applications/MAMP/logs/php_error.log

Paste it into the Terminal. 
And it will give an error log of whatever project MAMP is pointed to at that time.
