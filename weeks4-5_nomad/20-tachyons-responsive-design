Using tachyons for responsive styles
Tachyons is really clever and letâ€™s us add styles that get triggered at certain responsive breakpoints.

/* not small styles with `-ns` on the end */
@media screen and (min-width: 30em) {}

/* medium styles with `-m` on the end */
@media screen and (min-width:30em) and (max-width:60em) {}

/* large styles with `-l` on the end */
@media screen and (min-width:60em) {}


-----------


<div class="pa1 pa2-m pa4-l w-100 w-two-thirds-m w-50-l">
  Huzzah!
</div>

Here we change our element width and padding units at medium and large breakpoints by attaching -m and -l to the end of our class names.

Combining our classes we can trigger styles at different breakpoints.

pa1 w-100 (not small, for mobile)
pa2-m w-two-thirds-m (for screen sizes that are not small i.e. medium i.e. ipad)
pa4-l w-50-l (for screens above medium i.e. large i.e. desktop)

The large relates to responsive design

1em is roughly equal to 16px.
So when screen is 30em that is 480px wide

ns - not small - any measurement above 30em
m - medium
l - large
