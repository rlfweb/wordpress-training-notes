Can upload an image directly into Media Libary in Wordpress Dashboard. 

Then if you click on the image, you get the Attachment Details opening up. 

Check the url and the final number is the unique id that wordpress gives each image i.e. 54

So you can use that image within your content.php by using this code below, put inside a div: 

<div class="gallery-image">
<?php echo wp_get_attachment_image(54, 'full'); ?>
</div>

The full refers to image size. Go into Settings, Media and you will get the options that wordpress give you. We'd usually want full and then style it with css. 

If you upload that and then inspect it in Chrome, you can see that Wordpress gives it width and height attributes that are hard coded in. Which stops it being responsive. 

Within custom.css 
/* here we overwrite the size within wordpress so it scales responsively with the page*/
.gallery-image img {
  width: auto !important;
  height: auto !important;
}

You need the !important to overwrite the existing styles.
