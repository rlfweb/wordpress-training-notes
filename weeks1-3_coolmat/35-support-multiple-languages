We use Polylang, a translation plugin for wordpress

that means whenever we go to coolmat.com/kr it loads in Korean or coolmat.com/es it loads in Spanish or coolmat.com/de it loads in German etc. etc. 

There are a variety of translation plugins - polylang was the best fit for this coolmat project. 

Dashboard, Plugins, Add New, search for Polylang by WP SYNTEX 

If you go through the setup screen, add English first so all posts default to that. Code will be en and Order will be 0. 

Then add Korean. 

Or when you activate the Polylang plugin, you get another tab on your Dashboard called Languages. Can go through that and add English first and then Korean after. 

For Korean, language code will be kr and the Order will be 1.
