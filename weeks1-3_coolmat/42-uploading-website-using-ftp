NEED TO WATCH SUPERHI WORDPRESS VIDEO FOR THIS 

File Transfer Protocol

We can connect to server just like we can do with folders on our computer. 

Go to SFTP tab under Access in our fortrabbit Dashboard

There are three parts:

We need a server address

We need a username

We need a password - this is our fortrabbit account password 

We are going to use an application to connect to our FTP. 

It's called transmit, made by company called Panic. It's a paid for option. 

Otherwise try Cyberduck which is free. 

Using Trnsmit, load it up. 
Lawrence already has some files there. 
Now connect to new Coolmat server. 
Add new SFTP server.
