Editing the theme

The homepage has index.php which we see by default on the homepage. It combines togeher header.php, a loop of content.php files and then our footer.php at teh bottom.  

Proably want to upload a bit of content first by putting a couple of posts with images onto the site. 

Open the coolmat theme by dragging the folder onto Visual Studio Code. 

Initially, want to delete all you don't want. 
In our design for coolmat, we don't use a sidebar, so we'll get rid of it altogether. The sidebar contains this kind of stuff: 
-Recent posts
-Recent Comments
-Archives
-Categories
-Meta

Open index.php from within the coolmat theme
around line 58 it has a template tag that says get_sidebar();
There are lots of template tags in wordpress. They let us grab data from workdpress and display it inside of our templates.

Delete this sidebar template tag and you can get rid of sidebar

If you go into template-parts/content.php
you can comment out the bits you don't want such as 
coolmat_posted_on();
coolmat_posted_by();

You can also comment out the title or the thumbnail picture etc etc.
