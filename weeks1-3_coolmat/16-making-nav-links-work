It's a one page website so anything we click will link to the same page

But we want the nav to take us down the page to i.e. the directions

We do that through id tags. 

If you go to Wikipedia and you have the contents list, you click on i.e. Development and #Development gets added to the url and it whizzes you down to that part of the page. 

Go to index.php

Find the elements that you want to link to and add id to them. 

i.e. 
<!-- Intro and story element -->
	<div class="intro" id="intro">
	<div class="intro-inner">
		<h2 class="intro-title">Introducing 	
				<?php bloginfo('name'); ?><h2>


And the same for the menu id="food"

And then to make those links work, you go to Wordpress
Dashboard
Appearance
Menus
Menu Structure
Click on Custom link next to each item and change to the id you set earlier
i.e. URL would be #intro or #food or #directions
