Make it able to update from the dashboard. The way we do that is to make it a post. 

On Dashboard, under Posts menu, go to Categories

Add new category called intro
Give it a slug of intro
Add New Category 

Then open post
Give it a title of Introducing cool mat
Then, making sure we are in the Text side of the editor not the Visual side, copy the text from our code (rather than from website) so we have the br tags etc. 

<p class="intro-description">street food that was born in tough times. <br>street food that everybody loves.<br> <span class="yellow"><?php bloginfo('name'); ?> </span> is on a mission to provide future <br>flavor nostalgia of street food for men,<br> women, children, grandpas and grandmas.<br> we only use the best ingredients.</p>

We are unable to put php code directly onto website as that would leave it open to being hacked so need to replace 
<?php bloginfo('name'); ?> 
with
cool mat as text 

Then publish the post. 

Then we can see it in our list of posts, but we don't have it showing on our site. 

So we need to query for just one post and loop through it to display it:

<!-- We query here for our new intro category post and get just one single post -->

<?php query_posts(
	'posts_per_page=1
	&category_name=intro'
); ?>

<?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

	<!-- Intro and story element -->
	<div class="intro" id="intro">
		<div class="intro-inner">
			<h2 class="intro-title"><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
				<div class="intro-description">
					<?php the_content(); ?>
				</div>
		</div>
	</div>	

<?php 
endwhile;
endif; 
?>
