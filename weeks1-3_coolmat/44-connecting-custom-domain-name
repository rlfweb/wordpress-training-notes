NEED TO WATCH SUPERHI WORDPRESS VIDEO FOR THIS 

Housekeeping on website. 
One the live site, log into wordpress and go to Dashboard, Users, Your Profile and Generate Password under Account Management. 

This will allow you to put in a strong password, if you don't have one already. 

Then save it. So no-one else can get access to the wp control panel. 

Buy a domain from namecheap.com. Superhi uses iwantmyname.com 
Lawrence bought coolmat.club 

Wtihin the fortrabbit dashboard there's a Settings box and if you click on Domains, you can add new one to that.

Add new domain and Add Domain. 

Then it gives us the DNS settings. 
Target DNS settings should match our Actual DNS settings 

Then go to your domain name company like iwantmyname and go to the DNS Manager for the coolmat.club domain name. 
Then copy the target settings over from fortrabbit to iwantmyname 

The A record should point to i.e. 52.18.136.112
A CNAME record should point to i.e. coolmat.frb.io. 

Save DNS settings. 

Mine will be different to the ones above, see video for process. 

REfresh the fortrabbit page and the Target and Actual settings should be matching. 

If you go to coolmat.club you should get your website (might not happen immediately)

Then go to WP dashboard for live site. 
In Settings, General, change 
WordPress Address (URL) to https://www.coolmat.club/
Site Address (URL) to https://www.coolmat.club/
Copy these full addresses from your live site web address bar so you are sure they are absolutely correct. 

This will redirect us back to the WP login. 

It says the page isn't secure, but it takes a while to get the security certificate. But it should come thorugh and then get your secure cert.
