If our content requires lots of different bits of data beyond a title, date, image and some content? Say we wanted to add a spice level or some ingredients to our food menu items? 

To do this we can use custom fields to attach extra data to our posts. 

WordPress was originally designed as a blogging system, so it has title, body text, categories, tags, featured image coming as default. 

For example, a company's About Us page might have a Name, role, location, biog, twitter and instagram handle. These are all custom fields within the posts. 

the_title(); could be the name 
the_field('role'); could be the job title 
the_field('location); could be where they live 
the_content(); could be the biography 
the_post_thumbnail(); could be the photo 

Hard coding our custom fields can get quite tricky to manage when our website starts growing, for both us and our clients. 

We can instead rely on the Advanced Custom Fields plugin for doing more advanced things for your content. You have a UI you can go through and add and edit all these fields to your posts.
