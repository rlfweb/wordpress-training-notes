Have a heading at the top
Then menu items in two columns and 3 rows with pixel gaps between rows and columns

Go to index.php

We go through loop and grab the data for each post (or menu item) and display them. 

CAN DELETE THIS AS WITH THE SCREEN-READER-TEXT WE ARE NOT VIEWING IT AS A PAGE SO DON'T NEED THE TITLE HERE

			if ( is_home() && ! is_front_page() ) :
				?>
				<header>
					<h1 class="page-title screen-reader-text"><?php single_post_title(); ?></h1>
				</header>
				<?php
			endif;

      WE are going to wrap all the posts in a div with a class of "food-grid"
      And put all our php loop code inside of that div

      CSS grid
      Solves a lot of layout problems. It's very powerful. 
      We are going to use a small part of it. 
      i.e. this below puts our six posts (menu items) into two columns and three rows, with gaps between. 

  .food-grid {
    display: grid;
  /* 1 fraction 1 fraction is 2 columns */
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-row-gap: 50px;
    grid-column-gap: 20px;
    max-width: 1220px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
  }
