If we want to create a box of same width and height, it's not that straightforward. 
i.e. 400x400 or 600x600

On the element's style:
background-color: blue:
padding-bottom: 100%

The padding is relative to the width of the element. If you say 50% you get a 2x1 block. Or 200% you get a 1x2 block. 

We are going to position map so it takes up 100% of the box here. 

In custom.css

/* here we create ourselves a box that has 1.33 x 1 dimensions using padding-bottom trick (also known as aspect ratio box in css */
.map-inner {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 75%;
}

/* here we overide the default width and height of the map */
.map-inner iframe {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 100% !important;
  height: auto !important;
}
