WordPress does things like constantly inserting paragraph tags onto our text, without our knowledge. 

So we go to CSS and go to bottom, above our media queries. 

for font-size can put in 4vw

vw stands for viewport width
So 100vw would mean our letters are the width of the viewport. 
4vw means our letters are 4% of the width of the viewport

This means they scale down nicely as the viewport shrinks and we always get our <br> tags breaking nicely where we want them to. 

And then the other changes within custom.css media queries
