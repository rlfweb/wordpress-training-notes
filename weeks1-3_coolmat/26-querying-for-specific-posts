In WordPress we don't always have to loop over all our available posts. We can write a QUERY to get only the ones we want. 

Can google wordpress query_posts
https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/query_posts/
and this has lots of background info

But if I want to do something specific I'll google that question: 
wordpress loop display one post - stack overflow is great at finding out how things work


We could say that we want posts from a certain category, how many we want and order them in a certain way. 

Need to change categories of posts - by default wordpress creates posts with an uncategorised category. 
In dashboard, posts, categories, we can change our posts to i.e. menu and change the slug too. 
This will mean the posts can be grabbed hold of using the category_name


Querying for posts 

For our hero we want to grab one randm food menu item and display the name of it after cool mat. How do we go about that? 

By using query_posts we can get ourselves displaying just the posts we want from the ones on our dashboard. We can get ...
- posts from the food category
- limit it to just one post 
- make it a random one each time (can choose other orders like ASC ascending, DESC descending, by title etc.)

query_posts(); and in the brackets we put our parameters or options - the things we want it to grab. separate them with ampersand &

We query for our post and then loop over it, even though there's only one. 

<?php query_posts(
	'posts_per_page=1
	&category_name=menu
	&orderby=rand'
); ?>

<?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

<div class="hero">
	<div class="hero-inner container">
		<h1 class="hero-text">
	<!-- here we use the template tag to grab the site name -->
			<span class="hero-sitename">
				<?php bloginfo('name'); ?>
			</span> 
				<?php the_title(); ?>
		</h1>
		<p class="hero-description">
		<span class="magenta">
				<?php bloginfo('name'); ?> </span> <?php bloginfo('description') ?>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>	

<?php 
endwhile;
endif; 
?>


============

If we scroll down the page, all the following loops are now using our query from before. 
So we need to make a new query further down, that the later loop with use. 

Here we make sure to override our query otherwise the one from above will still be used in this loop. Code reads from top to bottom

<?php
query_posts("posts_per_page=20&category_name=menu");

		if ( have_posts() ) :
			$item_number = 1; 
			while ( have_posts() ) :
				the_post();

				get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_type() );
				$item_number++;
			endwhile;

			the_posts_navigation();

		else :

			get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'none' );

			$item_number++;
		endif;
?>
