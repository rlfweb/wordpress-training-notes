To make a variable in php, you use dollar sign.
you'd set the variable: 

<?php $name = "lawrence" ?>
<?php $age = 27 ?>

then use the variable (echo means to print it out - to make it visible on the screen)

<h1>
  My name is
  <?php echo $name; ?>
  and I am
  <?php echo $age; ?>
</h1>

This would print out
My name is lawrence and I am 27

Then a few down: 

Hi I bumped onto this thread, wondering how to do that too. Found out it's bloody easy. In the main template file, for example index.php, declare a variable $post_idx before the loop, and within the loop increment that var. Like this:

<?php $post_idx = 0; while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
  <?php
    get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() );
    $post_idx++;
  ?>
<?php endwhile; ?>
Then in your content template (for example content.php) that is executed everytime within the loop, just make $post_idx global and then use it to your needs:

global $post_idx;
print "<p>{$post_idx}</p>";
That's it!


So make the changes to index.php and content.php as described above and as shown in the files for the superhi coolmat website.
