Add intro text into custom post type area

Go into Wordpress dashboard and copy over the text from intro post into new Intros custom post type 

Select Intro category and publish

Then bin the old one and empty bin, to clear it out. 

To display the post, we can query by category name, we can also query by type of post. 

For example, if we were making an online shop, we could do 
<?php query_posts( 'post_type=product'); ?>

And with that we can then loop over the custom posts as we're used to doing already 

So in index.php, where we query for our posts to display the intro, change category_name=intro to post_type=intro
