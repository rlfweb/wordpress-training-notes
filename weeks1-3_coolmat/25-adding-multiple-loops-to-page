Take the content we have already and making it dynamic and updateable

Currently our site has lots of hard coded parts to it, with just one DYNAMIC part for our food menu items. 

By using multiple loops we can display posts from different places in custom ways and make it all dynamic and changeable

wordpress loop to get the hero section to display not the hard coded 'fried seaweed roll' but instead, grab a random food menu item and display it alongside coolmat. 

Just google wordpress loop to get some of that code i.e. 

<?php 
if ( have_posts() ) {
	while ( have_posts() ) {
		the_post(); 
		//
		// Post Content here
		//
	} // end while
} // end if
?>
