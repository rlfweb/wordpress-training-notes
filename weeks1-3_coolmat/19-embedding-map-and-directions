Will hard code it first and then make it dynamic later, so it can be edited from within wordpress

In index.php

Put in a new div:

<div class="section-heading" id="locations">
	Directions to cool mat 
</div>

And then rename the food-title class in the css to section-heading. 

And then remember to find in index.php where you had used the food-title and change that also to section-heading

And then you have made a reusable class for all headings 

Set up the divs for the structure of the map area - see index.php 

And then we are going to put a live googlemap on the page. 
So go to googlemaps and type in the address. 
284-10 Yeomchang-dong, Gangseo-gu, Seoul

You click SHARE
Then Embed a map 
Select Medium size
And then Copy the HTML

Gives us an iframe tag that we paste into our map-inner class div

And iframe tag is a bit like a black hole (we have no control over the content inside of there) that allows us to embed content from other websites like widgets, facebook comments, tweets. These are iframe tags. 
Is it a source that you trust and would want to embed on your site?
