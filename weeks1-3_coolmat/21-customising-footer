Open footer.php

Get rid of all the content inside of "site-info" div

Set up 2 new divs. 
Lefthand content - footer-copyright
Two ways to get copyright symbol. Can just copy and paste it from the internet. Or can do &copy; or various other ones. 
Hard code the year in for now. And the company. All Rights Reserved
Righthand content - footer-social
Two anchor tags linking to facebook and instagram
<a href=""></a>
Give it a class of social-links

Style it up as per custom.css 

Good way to get one div on one side and one on the other is to use display: flex and then justify content. 

display: flex;
justify-content: space-between;

And then style up and put images in as per footer.php and custom.css
