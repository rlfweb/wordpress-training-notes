Wordpress Dashboard, Plugins, Add New

Search for Advanced Custom Fields. The first one, by Elliot Condon

Look at how many reivews, how many stars, how many installations, when it was last updated to decide which ones to use. 

Click Install Now

Then Instead of clicking Activate, go to Installed Plugins tab on the left hand side menu of Dashboard. 

Click Activate under Advanced Custom Fields

This puts a new Menu at the bottom of our Dashborad called Custom Fields. 

Field Groups are groups of custom inputs that we can attach to our posts. 

Add New Field Group and name it Locations Group 

We want a field for our map, so add a Field Label of Map

This automatically puts map in Field Name

Field Type can be Text

Everything else we can leave as it is. 

Don't need to click +Add Field as this is done automatically for us. 

We do need to change the Location box options. 

Where it says
Show this field group if Post Type is equal to [Post] change this to [Location] (remember Location is one of our custome post types that we created before)

We can also add other rule groups so for example if Post Type is equal to intro, for example. 

We don't need the extra Options below. 

Click Publish and it's ready to use. 

If we go to Locations in our Dashboard (our new post type) and open the Seoul post, we have a new field at the bottom called Map. 

You can put anything in there like 'Hello, does this custom field work?' and then you can update it to test it. 

Go back to the ACF website and on the homepage, where it says Made for developers, you can see in single.php the text you would use: 

<?php if( get_field('sub_heading') ): ?>
    <h2><?php the_field('sub_heading'); ?></h2>
<?php endif; ?>

i.e. if you have this field called sub_heading, use the field called sub_heading

So we'll use it like this, pasted into the correct place in index.php 

<?php if( get_field('map') ): ?>
<?php the_field('map'); ?>
<?php endif; ?>

And then you can save and refresh your page. If you see Hello, does this custom field work?
then you know it works. 

And then you can replace it with your google iframe tag.
