Go to Wordpress
Dashboard
Settings
General

And under Tagline it says Just another WordPress site

Change this to what you want i.e.

Street food that everybody loves


You can reuse that if you want to by looking at this page: 
https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/bloginfo/

And you can see there you put this code below into wherever you want that tagline to appear: 

<h1>
<?php bloginfo('description'); ?>
</h1>
